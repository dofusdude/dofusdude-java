There is one exception! **The API will _always_ choose being up-to-date over everything else**. So if Ankama decides to drop languages from the game like they did with their website, the API will loose support for them, too.  ## Thank you! I highly welcome everyone on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/3EtHskZD8h) to just talk about projects and use cases or give feedback of any kind.  The servers have a fixed monthly cost to provide very fast responses.
